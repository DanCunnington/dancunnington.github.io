## Background

Over the weekend of 17th-19th June, IBMers from across the business came together to hack a disruptive banking solution for the Royal Bank of Scotland at their campus location in Edinburgh. Team LightHouse, consisting of Maxine Mackie, Christopher Hay, Ellie Lee, Daniel Cunnington and 4 days into his IBM placement Nader Issa met for the first time on Friday. We were challenged to create a solution that disrupts financial services whilst providing a benefit to both the customer and the bank.
